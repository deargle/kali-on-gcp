Put the ssh username and private key filename into the Vagrantfile for a user
who should be able to ssh into your box _via gcp auth_. The kali image is
set up to allow auth from the google cloud auth engine, which means you only
need to specify the public key and username in the project metadata, and
then you should be able to get into kali.

You also need to have added an account.json file that will give packer access
to your gcp project

If this image is to become a base image for others to launch, then step down
the disk space and relaunch before creating the image. resizefs should (hopefully)
automatically run on the image as it launches. Then create your image.


# De-ICE VulnHub

To get [De-ICE level 1](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/de-ice-s1100,8/) onto Kali:

* Create a libirt virtual network with the following config:

        <network connections="1">
          <name>De-ICE</name>
          <uuid>c8b50fe2-876b-439a-9f6c-97d78a5a5dad</uuid>
          <forward mode="nat">
            <nat>
              <port start="1024" end="65535"/>
            </nat>
          </forward>
          <bridge name="virbr3" stp="on" delay="0"/>
          <mac address="52:54:00:2a:33:af"/>
          <domain name="De-ICE"/>
          <ip address="192.168.1.1" netmask="255.255.255.0">
          </ip>
        </network>

* Download the ISO:

    wget http://hackingdojo.com/downloads/iso/De-ICE_S1.100.iso

* Create a new virtual machine in kali. We're only going to use it to boot off of
  the ISO, so doesn't need storage.
    * set to use ISO. Add storage pool and point to De-ICE_S1.100.iso
    * Generic Linux
    * Default cpu and memory
    * Uncheck "Enable storage"
    * Name it something nice
    * Network selection > select your De-ICE network.
    * Finish
* You may need to mount the ISO again, after the first boot.
* Does not respond to ping (icmp). nmap -O 192.168.1.100 to ensure online.
