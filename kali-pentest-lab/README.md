Put the ssh username and private key filename into the Vagrantfile for a user
who should be able to ssh into your box _via gcp auth_. The kali image is
set up to allow auth from the google cloud auth engine, which means you only
need to specify the public key and username in the project metadata, and
then you should be able to get into kali.

You also need to have added an account.json file that will give packer access
to your gcp project

If this image is to become a base image for others to launch, then step down
the disk space and relaunch before creating the image. resizefs should (hopefully)
automatically run on the image as it launches. Then create your image.
